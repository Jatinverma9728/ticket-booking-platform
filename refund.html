                    <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
                    <p>At EventFare, we strive to ensure customer satisfaction with every ticket purchase. However, we understand that circumstances may arise where a refund is necessary. This policy outlines our approach to refunds for tickets purchased through our platform.</p>

                    <h2>2. Event Cancellation</h2>
                    <p>If an event is cancelled by the organizer, all ticket purchasers will receive a full refund of the ticket price and any associated fees, except for delivery fees if physical tickets have already been shipped.</p>

                    <h2>3. Event Postponement or Rescheduling</h2>
                    <p>If an event is postponed or rescheduled, tickets will typically be valid for the new date. If you are unable to attend the rescheduled date, you may be eligible for a refund. Please contact us within 14 days of the announcement of the new date to request a refund.</p>

                    <h2>4. Change of Venue</h2>
                    <p>If an event's venue is changed after ticket purchase and the new venue is more than 30 miles from the original venue, you may be eligible for a refund if you no longer wish to attend. Please contact us within 14 days of the venue change announcement.</p>

                    <h2>5. Refund Requests for Other Reasons</h2>
                    <p>Refund requests for reasons other than those listed above are subject to the event organizer's policy. Many events have a "no refund" policy for change of mind or inability to attend. Please check the specific event's terms and conditions before purchasing tickets.</p>

                    <h2>6. Processing of Refunds</h2>
                    <p>Approved refunds will be processed within 10 business days and will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. Please note that it may take an additional 5-10 business days for the refund to appear on your statement, depending on your financial institution.</p>

                    <h2>7. Exceptions</h2>
                    <p>In certain circumstances, such as suspected fraudulent activity or violation of our terms of service, we reserve the right to deny a refund request.</p>

                    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
                    <p>If you have any questions about our refund policy or need to request a refund, please contact our customer support team at <a href="mailto:support@eventfare.com">support@eventfare.com</a> or call us at 1-800-123-4567.</p>
